It is not a secret that the environment is an essential factor in a person's
efficiency and happiness. In previous years, applicants to
[Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/) have faced the problem of
random distribution to rooms during check-in on campus. That risked a student
getting both _suitable_ roommates, which is a good case, and _unsuitable_
roommates, which is a bad case.

The [Randorm](https://github.com/randorm) is designed to distribute
applicants/students into rooms based on their interest in each other.
